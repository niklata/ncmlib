ncmlib - POSIX and Linux C utility library for common functions
(C) 2010-2015 Nicholas J. Kain.  Licensed under 2-clause BSD.

INTRODUCTION
------------

This library is used by many of my programs.  It is statically linked, and
should be extracted to a ncmlib subdirectory in the program source directory
before building.

OVERVIEW
--------

exec         =>       Creation of subprocesses
io           =>       Wrappers for low-level i/o functions
log          =>       Logging to stdio or syslog
malloc       =>       Allocate-or-die wrappers
net_checksum =>       IP checksum functions
network      =>       (obsolete) socket API wrappers
pidfile      =>       Pidfile creation
privilege    =>       Drop uid/gid/capabilities securely
random       =>       PRNG, uses PCG (asm on x86/x86-64)
seccomp_bpf  =>       Wrappers for Linux seccomp syscall restriction
signals      =>       Wrappers for signal hooks
